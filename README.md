# ToDoTasks

My first independent project using Go. It will have the simple functionalities of creating, editing, and deleting to-do tasks. It will also display to-do tasks only when they are relevant to the currently logged in user.

This project is mainly to help sink in the fundamentals of Go and to gain mastery over the language.
